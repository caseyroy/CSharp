/*
Given two arrays of ints
return the symmetric differences, (aka disjunctive union)
    - these are the elements which are in either of the sets and not their intersection (the union without the intersection)
think of a venn diagram filled in except the ovlerapping middle part is not filled in (the intersection is excluded)
    - i.e., if an element is in at least one of the arrays, but not in any other, it should be included (dupes included 1 time only)
